# Encrypted
Here you can find all encrypted projects, this is most likely due to UiO rules regarding the Mandatory Assignments or lacking rights to content. As always, you can find the password in my CV (not the one on this website) or request it provided that you are not currently student at UiO taking any of IT-subjects. 

### What you can find:

- Most of my **Mandatory Assignments**

- The project files to
