# Happy Food

Happy Foods helps you keep you body happy, by making it easier to know whether a allergen is present in a product or meal. (Currently aim to target Lactose, Gluten and diabetes)

The thought behind the web console is that companies where not to optimistic to have data of their product on a "platform / database" they couldn't control. Since I needed data from them to realize the project; I created a web console where they could add, update and delete their own product. Thats why I have the login buttons, so 2-3 trusted employees of the company could updated their product and hopefully add new once.

Unfortunately for me it proved difficult the cooperate with all companies and get data from them, so I scraped the idea and let it serve as a proof of concept.
