# My Shows

My Shows keeps track of all the shows you watch and how far you have progressed, so you don't need to keep guessing anymore!

**Current Status is that the Application still works, but iMDb is working on a new version of their website that might break this app; as this app is heavily reliant on the iMDb web pages.**

This is my first independent project and my second Android Application (both written in Kotlin). At the time of creation i couldn't find any proper data source with simple APIs, so I based my application on web-scraping iMDb pages, therefore it might be a touch slow to add long running shows (As it's actually looking up many pages).

<br>

I'm planning to take this application from web-scraping to using themoviedb's APIs, while keeping the design as it is, so the app can be used in the future, but I strongly recommend checking out my newer [**TV Tracker App - Binge**](https://github.com/Akisan98/Akisan98/releases)

### How open the project-files?

Files in this folder are encrypted due lacking rights to content used by the program / application. The **password** is provided in my CV or request it provided that you are not currently student at UiO taking any of IT-subjects. 

#### If you are running Windows:

Download all the files in a folder, and then run the .exe file to unzip the encrypted project-files.

#### If you are not using Windows:

Download 7-Zip to proceed s unzip the encrypted project-files

PS: This was my first independent project, and is messy as of now.
